    <h2>Rationale: Why Binhinav Exists</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>From Frustration to Fluidity</h3>
        <p class="section-description" style="margin-top: -0.5rem; margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
            We are solving a universal problem: the frustration of being lost in a large, unfamiliar indoor space.
            Traditional static directories and confusing signage are relics of a bygone era. They fail to engage
            visitors, create missed opportunities for tenants, and offer no valuable insights to venue operators. This
            disconnect leads to a poor visitor experience and operational inefficiency.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Binhinav was engineered to bridge this gap.</strong> We believe that navigating a physical space
            should be as intuitive as navigating a well-designed website. Our rationale is built on transforming the
            outdated directory into a dynamic, data-driven experience platform that serves everyone within the venue's
            ecosystem.</p>
