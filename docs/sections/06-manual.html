    <article id="manual-admin">
        <h3>Admin Portal: The Command Center</h3>
        <p>The Admin Portal provides full control over the venue's digital infrastructure. The typical workflow involves
            setting up the venue's structure first, then managing its day-to-day operations.</p>

        <h4>Initial Venue Setup</h4>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Before adding individual stores, the foundational elements of your venue must be configured. This is
                typically done only once or when major renovations occur.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>1. Manage Floor Plans:</strong> Navigate to the "Floor Plans" section. Here you will upload
                    the 2D map images for each level of your venue (e.g., "Ground Floor", "Level 2"). This is the canvas
                    on which everything else is placed.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Create Categories:</strong> Go to the "Categories" section to define the types of places
                    in your venue (e.g., "Food & Beverage", "Apparel"). Select a distinct icon for each to help visitors
                    with filtering.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Managing Places and Merchants</h4>
        <div class="card">
            <p>This is the core operational workflow for adding and managing tenant spaces.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Navigate to "Places" and click "Add New Place".</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Step 1 - Enter Details:</strong> Provide a name, select the correct Floor Plan, and then
                    choose how to handle the merchant account:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Assign Existing Merchant:</strong> Choose from a list of created merchants who are
                            not yet assigned to a place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create New Merchant:</strong> Select this to create a new merchant account (name,
                            username, password) that will be automatically linked to this new place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leave Unassigned:</strong> Create the place now and assign a merchant later.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 2 - Set Location:</strong> After submitting details, you will be prompted to click on
                    the floor plan map to place a pin, precisely marking the store's location.</li>
                <li><strong>Editing:</strong> You can edit any place's details or location at any time from the "Places"
                    page.</li>
